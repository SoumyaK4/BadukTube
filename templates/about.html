                    <h3>Backstory</h3>
                    <p>
                        All the videos(pre 2025 videos only) you see on this website was part of my Baduk Lecture PKM(Personal Knowledge Management), but it had accessibility issues, and I've been thinking of turning this into a website since 2022. Well finally 2025 magic :)<br>
                        So I decided to make a website to make it accessible from anywhere and to everyone(Assuming there's a lot of others like me who finds it hard to search for a specefic Go lecture on YouTube).
                    </p>
