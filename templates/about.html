                    <h3>Backstory</h3>
                    <p>
                        All the videos(pre March 2025 videos only) you see on this website was part of my Baduk Lecture PKM(something like obsidian/notion), but it had accessibility issues, and I've been thinking of turning this into a website since 2023. Well finally 2025 magic :)<br>
                        So I decided to make a website to make it accessible from anywhere and to everyone(Assuming there's a lot of others like me who finds it hard to search for a specefic Go lecture on YouTube).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Create a youtube playlist with relevant topics or videos for a certain rank group and share it with me. <br>
                        I imported over 500 videos in bulk from my PKM so a lot of videos might not have been assigned proper tags/topics/ranks.
                        If any rank, tag and topic isn't correctly assigned to any specefic video let me know. <br>
                        You can find my socials at the bottom of the page.
